            </div>
            <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.</p>
            <p>Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. Her you can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or travel back in time and meet Woolly Mammoth?</p>
            <p>We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.</p>
            <p>During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.</p>

                        constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used
                        the stars to travel by.</p>

                    <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved,
                        thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
                        history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
                        penicillin and the first heart transplant. </p>
                    <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing
                        animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where
                        do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have
                        had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
                    <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our
                        time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including
                        our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>
